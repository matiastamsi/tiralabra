# Week 3

- I have done user interface and IO classes both for console and testing purposes. Also, I have implemented reading the frequencies of letters in English and from the given cipher. The logic now works fully if the given cipher contains real text. There is flaws that I will fix next week.
- The project has been gone much forward. The testing and Javadoc will be next on my list.
- I have learned about the gradle's configuration (I had some major problems with it). Also, my thoughts are coming together and I think that on next week this program works as intended, fingers crossed!
- I would like to have some feed back how my backtracking works and where it doesn't. This is the hardest part of my project.
- Next I will do tests and javadocs so maybe I will find out where the backtracking fails. Then I will try to fix that.
- I have spent this week ~ 16 hours.
