# Week 4

- In this week I did implement some ordering of the letters based on frequencies. I did spent many hours to trying to get the backtracking to work. I also implemented tests and javadocs as much I could.
- After the discussion with Kärnä there was quite many things that were / are going to be refactored and changed. After I get the backtracking and recursion to work I think there ain't any major problems ahead.
- I have learned a lot of backtracking nad recursion. It is quite simple thing but for me it is a great challenge.
- The recursive backtracking is the most challenging but after the discussion I have a clear vision what I am going to do.
- Next I will fix the trie to not accept substrings as a word. Then I will replace all the functionalities that the Sentence object earlier possessed to be handled as a array. Also there is going to be a tree set of char-kind objects and boolean arrays to help in the recursion.
- I did spent at least 20 hours this week. Maybe more.
