## Week 5

- In this week I have been working with those changes that I discussed with Kärnä last week. Also, I added way to generate a cipher etc.
- I did do those changes that we dicussed. I didn't get the TreeSet to work that well and I had an idea about keeping track of the order in the Letter object. I think it will works fine.
- I have learned more about recursion, backtracking, tree set etc.
- The backtracking isn't working still. But I think I know how to make the major problem to go away. Sadly, I have so much to do currently so I didn't have time to do it this week.
- Next I will fix the backtracking and do unit tests. If I somehow manage in those, I will work with the documentation. I'm behind!
- I spent about 15 hours.
