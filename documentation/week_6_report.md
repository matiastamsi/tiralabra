# Week 6

- I didn't get the cracking to work. But I'm sure that I get it next week / before the demo. I have understood so many things now. I hope there would have been more time to do it for this week but I have to do it for week 7.
- After I get the recursion to work I will do all the testing etc. Performance testing before unit tests. 
- Next week (before demo) I have more time because I have to work less and other courses ends etc. I have my full focus now on to this and I guarantee that 16.5. everything is fine. I work hard to get as much as I can done before the demo.
- I spent time about 15 hours.
