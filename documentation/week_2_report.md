# Week 2

- What did I do this week?
  - I took the JaCoCo tool in to use to check the code coverage.
  - I added the checkstyle. There are many violations still but I will leave out some conditions later on.
  - I made JUnit tests for current classes (not for Main class). Test coverage are 100%.
  - So, the data structure Trie is "ready"/functioning. It creates a trie based on a file that contains 58,110 lines of English words. There could be more dictionaries or larger one but let's start with this. Now there is a possibility to check if a string is a word.
- I did have so many other things to do this week so I will do extra next week!
- I did learn to implement a trie. It was first a bit tricky but I did manage to get it right!
- I have a clear picture of what I am doing at a time.
- Next I will implement the backtracking. Frequencies will be added later. So, the idea is to get it work like with bruteforce. When it works, then the frequencies are added to make it more efficient.
- I spent about 8 hours this week.
